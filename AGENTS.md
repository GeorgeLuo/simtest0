# Agent Instructions

1. Review the latest simulation guidelines in `instruction_documents/index.md`, then open the referenced `_theory.md`, `_codifying_simulations.md`, `_bootstraps.md`, and `_master_prompt.md` files for full context.
2. When building artifacts, work inside `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/` (create it if it does not exist) and rely on the `instruction_documents` materials to guide structure and process.
3. Add reusable automation to `tools/` with entries in `tools/index.md`, and run validations through the repository-level `checks.sh` script, recording results under `verifications/` when available.
