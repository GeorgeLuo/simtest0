# AGENT ORIENTATION

1. Start with `instruction_documents/index.md` to choose the smallest useful context for your task.
2. Use `instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_table_of_contents.md` when you need the full heading map.
3. Before acting, load the matching mindset prompt from `instruction_documents/mindset_prompts/index.md`.
4. Record outcomes in `memory/records/` and update long-lived assumptions in `memory/ways/` when decisions affect future work.
