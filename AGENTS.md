Welcome to the simulation workspace. Review `instruction_documents/index.md` before generating or executing tasks to pick the correct guidance.

The authoritative source document is `Describing_Simulation_0.md`; ensure derived instruction files stay aligned with its latest revision.

Implementers should work inside `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0` and record outcomes in `memory/records/` after each task.
