All directories listed below are located at the root of this repository:

- **Workspaces**: `workspaces/` — active implementation efforts for the current revision belong here.
- **Tools**: `tools/` — scripts and automation utilities live here for reuse.
- **Memory**: `memory/` — contains long-term guidance in `memory/ways/` and short-term records in `memory/records/`.
- **Verifications**: `verifications/` — outputs from validation and test runs should be stored here.
