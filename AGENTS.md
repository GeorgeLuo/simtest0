# Agent Checklist

1. Read `Describing_Simulation_0.md` and the files under `instruction_documents/` before creating tasks or writing code. Always confirm you are working from the most recent revision.
2. Capture planning assumptions in `memory/ways/` and log task outcomes in `memory/records/` to keep the workspace current.
3. Use `checks.sh` as the single entry point for validation; extend it as automated tests become available.
4. Treat `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/` as the active implementation area for this revision of the specification.

Report any unexpected repository changes before proceeding with new work.
