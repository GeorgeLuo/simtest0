# Agent Instructions

This repository follows a spec-as-code development pattern.

- All development work should be driven by specifications stored in this repository.
- When adding or modifying features, update or add the relevant specification files.
- Commit messages should be in the present tense and summarize the change briefly.
- Run available tests or linters for the affected areas before committing.
- Leave the working tree in a clean state after each task.
- Maintain approach-level notes in the `agent_memory/` directory. Use text files
  to document styles, patterns, or other reusable insights. Update this
  directory passively whenever user prompts include approach-level information.

These instructions should be reused by any agent contributing to this repository.
