# Repository Guidelines

- For the latest project context and instructions, always refer to [`Describing_Simulation_0.md`](./Describing_Simulation_0.md).
- Keep new automation or validation steps inside `checks.sh`; update this file when real tests become available.
- Unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` indicates otherwise, run `./checks.sh` before committing substantive changes.
