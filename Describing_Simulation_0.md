# Describing Simulation 0

The Simulation 0 guidance has been modularized into focused instruction documents located in [`instruction_documents/`](instruction_documents/). Review [`instruction_documents/index.md`](instruction_documents/index.md) for an overview of each reference, or navigate directly to the sections below:

- [Theory](instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_theory.md) — foundations for framing hypotheticals, defining environments, and outlining the simulation context.
- [Codifying Simulations](instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md) — architectural guidance for building the engine, managing systems, and approaching development workflows.
- [Bootstraps](instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_bootstraps.md) — repository setup steps for organizing instructions, tools, workspaces, and verification assets.
- [Master Prompt](instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_master_prompt.md) — role expectations and task sequencing for agents collaborating on Simulation 0.
