# TDD Strategy

This workflow comes from `human_input/Describing_Simulation_8-1-2025.md` (or its latest version) and should be reviewed before coding.

- Generate skeleton files without implementation from descriptions.
- Write comment-only tests expressing intended behavior.
- Convert comments into executable tests that import the skeletons.
- Implement business logic to satisfy the tests.
- Run tests and iterate until all pass.
