# Time Notes

- Implemented TimeComponent and TimeSystem per checkpoint III.
- Followed TDD: wrote tests before implementing logic.
- Initial pass did not reveal placement details in Describing_Simulation_8-1-2025.
- After reviewing, TimeComponent lives in `src/ecs/components/implementations` and TimeSystem in `src/ecs/systems/implementations` per the document.
