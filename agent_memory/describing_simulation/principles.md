# Principles from Describing Simulation

- Model relevant systems, set values, and compute results to answer quantitative hypotheticals.
- Build simulations from natural language prompts via validation, intent extraction, and codification.
- Scope focuses on problems with:
  - **Comparative temporality** – compare environment states across time segments.
  - **Endogeneity** – phenomena are part of the environment and influence it.
  - **Relational conditionality** – relationships define exit conditions and environment design.
- Interpret prompts as intent-complete and mappable to computational simulations.
- Treat hypotheticals endogenously even if phrased exogenously.
- Bound observation by phenomena-derived time windows and explicit exit conditions.
- Initialize environments before phenomena occur to capture temporal contrast.
- Highly constrained hypotheses enable more successful simulation design.
