# Tools Directory

## Purpose

The `tools` directory centralizes helper scripts that support development,
validation, and operational workflows for this repository. Use this space to
capture automation that developers can run locally or in CI to set up the
project, manage dependencies, or perform routine maintenance.

## Available Scripts

### `bootstrap.sh`

A placeholder Bash script intended to orchestrate environment bootstrap tasks
(e.g., installing dependencies or preparing configuration files). The script
currently acts as documentation only and prints a notice while the concrete
steps are defined.

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Planned Utilities

Additional helper scripts should be added here as the project matures. When a
new script is introduced, document its purpose, usage, and any prerequisites in
this index to keep contributors aligned on available tooling.
