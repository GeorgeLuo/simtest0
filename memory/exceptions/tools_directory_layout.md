# Tools Directory Layout Exception

The repository tool layout differs from the source manuscript. CLI scripts live under `tools/cli/` and developer utilities live under `tools/dev/` to keep the root `tools/` directory clean. The extracted instruction documents reflect this layout; the original `Describing_Simulation_0.md` still lists `tools/start.sh` and `tools/run_integration.sh` at the root.
