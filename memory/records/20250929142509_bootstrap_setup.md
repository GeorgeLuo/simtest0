# Bootstrap Setup

- Created repository scaffolding directories (`instruction_documents/`, `tools/`, `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/`, `verifications/`, `memory/ways/`, `memory/records/`).
- Added `tools/index.md` and an executable `checks.sh` stub to guide future automation.
- Split `Describing_Simulation_0.md` into dedicated instruction documents with an index for navigation.
- Introduced `AGENTS.md` to direct contributors toward the latest guidance prior to tasking.
- Captured long-term assumptions in `memory/ways/foundational_assumptions.md`.
