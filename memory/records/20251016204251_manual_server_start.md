# Manual Server Start â€“ 2025-10-16T20:42Z

- Ran `npm run build` in `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0` to ensure the latest TypeScript output before launching.
- Spawned `node dist/main.js` in the background (PID 24314) with logs piped to `tmp_manual_server.log`.
- Confirmed the instance is responding via `curl http://localhost:3000/health` returning HTTP 200.
- Note: `tmp_manual_server.log` still contains a prior `EADDRINUSE` error entry from earlier attempts; current process is healthy.
