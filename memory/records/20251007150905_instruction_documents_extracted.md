# Task Record — Phase 1 Bootstrapping Checkpoint 1

## Summary
- Created `instruction_documents/` with `mindset_prompts/` scaffold per Bootstraps guidance.
- Parsed `Describing_Simulation_0.md` into dedicated section files: theory, codifying simulations, bootstraps, implementation guidelines, schedule of work, master prompt, and mindset prompts.
- Copied the full source document into `instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0.md`.
- Generated `Describing_Simulation_0_table_of_contents.md` capturing heading hierarchy (H1–H4) for quick navigation.

## Validation
- Confirmed each extracted file retains original heading levels and trailing newline formatting.
- Verified mindset prompt files reside under `instruction_documents/mindset_prompts/` with correct naming convention.

## Status
- Checkpoint 1 complete; tasks 2 and 3 from `20251007150441_bootstrap_task_queue.md` remain open for Implementer pickup.
