## Context
Turned the remaining EntityManager test notes into executable coverage and filled in the manager so the suite describes concrete behavior.

## Findings
- Added Vitest coverage that exercises entity creation order, destruction semantics, and the component cleanup contract.
- Implemented the EntityManager with create, destroy, and lookup helpers that delegate component removal to the ComponentManager.
- Installed project dependencies and ran `npm test` to confirm all suites pass under the new coverage.

## Next steps
- Extend the manager with orchestration helpers once system-level requirements arrive.
