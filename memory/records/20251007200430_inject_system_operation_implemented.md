# Task Record â€” Inject System Operation Implementation

## Summary
- Implemented `InjectSystemOperation` to delegate to the IO player and emit success acknowledgements; invalid payloads now throw explicit errors.
- Added unit coverage ensuring a system is passed through and missing payloads are rejected.

## Validation
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test -- injectSystemOperation.test.ts`
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test`

## Status
- Operation ready for inbound automation; structural audit discrepancy resolved.
