# Task Record â€” Phase 3 Task 3 (Automate Injection Workflow)

## Summary
- Implemented JSON-aware routing (`src/routes/router.ts`) with response helpers and request parsing to support HTTP automation, including SSE header flushing tweaks in simulation/evaluation routes for reliable streaming.
- Extended simulation bootstrap to load systems from module descriptors via the new loader in `src/main.ts`, wrapping arbitrary module exports into `System` instances and securing path resolution; registered helper wiring in `src/server/bootstrap.ts`.
- Authored temperature control plugin (`plugins/simulation/temperatureControlSystem.js`) and an integration runner (`tools/run_integration.js`) invoked by the enhanced `tools/run_integration.sh` to build the workspace, start the server, verify idle SSE state, inject the system over HTTP, and exercise playback controls.
- Added coverage for information/simulation routes and bootstrap wiring updates, ensuring Jest + TypeScript builds remain green.

## Validation
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test`
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 run build`
- `./tools/run_integration.sh`

## Status
- Task complete. Proceed to Phase 3 Task 4 (run full integration to capture behavioral evidence).
