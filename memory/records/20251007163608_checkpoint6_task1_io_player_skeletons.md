# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint VI Task 1

## Summary
- Created IO Player scaffolding:
  - `src/core/simplayer/IOPlayer.ts` with constructor and lifecycle stubs (`start`, `pause`, `stop`, inbound handling, frame publishing).
  - Operation skeletons under `src/core/simplayer/operations/` for start, pause, stop, inject, and eject behaviors.
- Build (`npm run build`) succeeds, confirming TypeScript integration.

## Status
- Task 1 complete. Proceed to Stage 2 to draft IO Player test intents.
