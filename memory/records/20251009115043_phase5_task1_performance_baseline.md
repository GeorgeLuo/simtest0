# Task Record — Phase 5 Task 1 (Performance Baseline)

## Summary
- Added `tools/benchmark_simulation.js` to launch the compiled workspace, stream 500 ticks, and capture runtime/memory metrics for optimization tracking.
- Baseline run captured `500` frames in `25426.0622 ms` (≈`19.6649` ticks/sec) with RSS increasing by ~2.0 MB; artifact stored at `verifications/20251009T155032_benchmark.json`.

## Observations
- Startup + injection overhead negligible relative to frame processing; main runtime is continuous tick evaluation.
- Memory footprint remains stable (heap delta negative, RSS +2 MB) suggesting allocations can be reclaimed—future work should focus on per-tick throughput.

## Validation
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 run build`
- `node tools/benchmark_simulation.js`
