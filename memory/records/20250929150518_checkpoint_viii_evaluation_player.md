# Checkpoint VIII Evaluation Player

- Added tests for frame injection operations and the evaluation player workflow, ensuring frames are stored and sanitized when emitted.
- Implemented evaluation-specific frame components, inject-frame operation, and handler registration helper.
- Created `EvaluationPlayer` extending `IOPlayer`, wiring default frame filtering and exposing an evaluation frame emission hook.
- Updated base `Player` to expose `runTick`/`emitFrame` for subclass reuse.
- Test suite (./checks.sh) passes with the new evaluation capabilities.
