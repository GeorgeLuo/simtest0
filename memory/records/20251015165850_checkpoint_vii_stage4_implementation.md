# Checkpoint VII Stage 4 Implementation

- Implemented playback operations so `StartOperation`, `PauseOperation`, and `StopOperation` delegate directly to the corresponding `IOPlayer` lifecycle methods while ignoring payload noise.
- Extended `SimulationPlayer` to auto-register start/pause/stop handlers via `MessageHandler` instances, binding them to the `simulation.<action>` message types outlined in `memory/ways/simulation_message_naming.md`.
- The inbound registry now resolves playback commands, setting the stage for successful acknowledgements and state transitions validated in Stage 5.
