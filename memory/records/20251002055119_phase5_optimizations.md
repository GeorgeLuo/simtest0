# Phase 5 Optimizations
- Added `EntityManager.forEach` and `ComponentManager.forEach` to traverse live collections without creating defensive snapshots, and refactored `IOPlayer.buildFrame` to use them, removing per-tick Map/Set allocations.
- Extended primitive tests to cover the new iteration helpers and confirm immutability expectations still hold.
- End-to-end behavior validated via `npm test` and `tools/run_integration.sh`; integration artifacts stored under `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/verifications/20251002T055108Z/`.
