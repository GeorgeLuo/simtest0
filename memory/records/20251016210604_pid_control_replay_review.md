# PID Control Replay Review – 2025-10-16T21:06Z

- Inspected `replays/pid_control` bundle delivered by external tester; contains README and `replay_pid_attempt.sh`.
- README summarises four blocking issues: stalled tick counter, empty SSE stream, 500 on `simulation.system.inject`, and evaluation player never starting.
- Script reproduces the flow—start sim, poll `/status`, sample `/simulation/stream`, upload PID plugin, attempt system injection, poll `/status`, stop sim—and logs discrepancies to `replay.log` plus `notes.txt`.
- No captured sample run present despite README reference; directory lacks `sample_run/replay.log`, suggesting artifact was omitted or not committed.
