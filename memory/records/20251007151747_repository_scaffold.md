# Task Record â€” Phase 1 Bootstrapping Checkpoint 3

## Summary
- Added `tools/index.md` documenting current utility scripts and upstream reference.
- Stubbed `tools/run_integration.sh` with executable placeholder messaging and `checks.sh` with TODO marker; both reference the bootstrapping instructions.
- Established `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/README.md` to reserve the artifact workspace for Phase 2.
- Documented verification artifact expectations in `verifications/README.md`.
- Confirmed `memory/records/` and `memory/ways/` remain available for future logging.

## Validation
- Verified new scripts are executable (`chmod +x`).
- Directory listings match the structure defined in `instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_bootstraps.md`.

## Status
- Phase 1 bootstrapping tasks (Checkpoints 1-3) complete. Ready to transition to Phase 2 task generation under the Tasker mindset.
