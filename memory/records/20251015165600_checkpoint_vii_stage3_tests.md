# Checkpoint VII Stage 3 Tests

- Implemented Vitest suites for SimulationPlayer lifecycle messaging in `src/core/simplayer/__tests__/SimulationPlayer.test.ts`, covering handler registration plus start/pause/stop acknowledgement flows and state transitions.
- Added Start/Pause/Stop operation unit tests under `src/core/simplayer/operations/__tests__/` to enforce delegation to `IOPlayer` lifecycle methods and success acknowledgements via `MessageHandler`.
- Ran `npm test`; new suites fail as expected pending Stage 4 implementation (`simulation` ack currently error, lifecycle spies not invoked).
