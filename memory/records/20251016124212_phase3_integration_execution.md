# Phase 3 Integration â€“ Execution 2025-10-16T12:41Z

- Ran `./tools/run_integration.sh` after ESM fixes; script completed all six stages successfully, leaving artifacts under `verifications/integration_20251016T124138/`.
- Key captures:
  - `/health`, `/`, `/information/api.md`, and `/information/Describing_Simulation.md` responses saved in `responses/`.
  - Plugin uploads recorded via `plugin_system_request.json`, `plugin_component_request.json`, and the resulting `codebase_tree.json`.
  - Evaluation frame payload and SSE transcript stored as `evaluation_frame_request.json` and `evaluation_stream.event`, demonstrating live stream output.
- Server log remained clean and the trap shut the process down at completion, confirming the integration harness can be rerun without manual cleanup.
