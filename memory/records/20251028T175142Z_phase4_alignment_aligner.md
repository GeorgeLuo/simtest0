# Phase 4 alignment sweep (aligner)

## Repository & instructions
- Confirmed instruction_documents match spec: ensured `Describing_Simulation_0_outsider_integration.md` restored from source spec; mindset prompts set (tasker, implementer, packager, outsider, aligner, optimizer).
- Bootstraps-defined directories present (tools/, workspaces/, verifications/, memory/ways|records|exceptions).

## Workspace structure
- `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src` tree matches documented code structure (core/, routes/, plugins/ etc.); no stray files beyond described tests and plugins stub.
- `tools/` contains `index.md`, `run_integration.sh`, `start.sh`, `run_integration.js`, `benchmark_simulation.js`; extra benchmark script noted but consistent with optimization phase records.

## API surface
- Root `GET /` now returns JSON guidance linking to `/api` and `/api/information/api`, aligning with API map "maximal discoverability" requirement.
- `/api` response unchanged; sample curl confirmed.

## Follow-up
- No structural gaps detected. Ready to return to optimizer mindset when further performance work resumes.
