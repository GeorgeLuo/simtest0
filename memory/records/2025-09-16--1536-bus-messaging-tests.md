## Context
Expanded the messaging bus test coverage requested by the latest task, ensuring failure propagation and subscription lifecycles are validated.

## Findings
- Added a dedicated Vitest suite for the bus to confirm successful delivery, error propagation, and unsubscribe behavior.
- Updated the shared `checks.sh` harness so messaging tests (including the new suite) run during verification.

- Share outcomes with future contributors via the upcoming commit message and verification artifact.
