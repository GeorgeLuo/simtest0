# Checkpoint VIII Stage 3 Tests

- Codified `InjectFrame` operation tests ensuring payload frames are forwarded to `EvaluationPlayer.ingestFrame` and success acknowledgements are emitted via `MessageHandler` (`src/core/evalplayer/operations/__tests__/InjectFrame.test.ts`).
- Added EvaluationPlayer suite covering handler registration, frame persistence into components, outbound filtering, and error acknowledgement behavior (`src/core/evalplayer/__tests__/EvaluationPlayer.test.ts`).
- Executed `npm test`; new suites fail as expected pending Stage 4 logic (handler registration missing, ingestFrame stubbed).
