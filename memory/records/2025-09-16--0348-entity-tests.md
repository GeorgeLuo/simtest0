## Context
Codified the outstanding Entity test intents by translating the notes into executable Vitest coverage. Implemented the Entity primitive so the new tests exercise concrete behavior instead of documentation-only placeholders.

## Findings
- Added a static identifier allocator to `Entity` so each instantiation produces a distinct numeric handle.
- Introduced enumeration helpers on `Entity` that delegate to the component manager, enabling tests to inspect attached components without bypassing the abstraction.
- Extended the test suite to attach multiple component types and confirm only the owning entity reports them during enumeration.

## Next steps
- Flesh out the EntityManager contract to coordinate lifecycle operations and propagate component cleanup when entities are destroyed.
