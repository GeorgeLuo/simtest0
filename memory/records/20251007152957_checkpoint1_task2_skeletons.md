# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint I Task 2

## Summary
- Replaced placeholder exports with typed skeletons for primitives under `src/core/`.
  - `entity/Entity.ts` now defines `Entity` aliases and an id factory helper.
  - `entity/EntityManager.ts` exposes lifecycle method stubs (`create`, `remove`, `has`, `list`).
  - `components/ComponentType.ts` models component type contracts and instance shape.
  - `components/ComponentManager.ts` outlines manager responsibilities with method signatures and doc comments.
- All methods currently throw `Error('Not implemented')` to enforce later Stage 4 implementations.

## Validation
- `npm run build` succeeds, confirming TypeScript skeletons compile.
- File structure matches the Codifying Simulations checkpoint layout.

## Status
- Task 2 complete; continue with Task 3 (comment-only test intents for primitives).
