# Phase 6 â€” Task Queue Update (Post-SSE Heartbeats)

## Context
- System lifecycle IDs (Task 1) and SSE heartbeats (Task 2) are complete with tooling/docs refreshed.
- Remaining focus shifts to authentication and rate limiting before broader exposure.

## Remaining Task
- **Task 3: Authentication & Rate Limiting Baseline**
  - Add configurable shared-secret auth middleware to `router.ts` and propagate across route registration.
  - Implement lightweight per-route throttling to deter local abuse while keeping defaults development-friendly.
  - Update API documentation (`routes/information/api.md`) and workspace README with usage instructions and configuration knobs.
