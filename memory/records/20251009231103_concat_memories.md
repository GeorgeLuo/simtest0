# Task Record â€” Memory Consolidation

## Summary
- Gathered existing memory records to prepare a single consolidated reference artifact.
- Captured current task context under the implementer mindset per `instruction_documents/mindset_prompts/Describing_Simulation_0_implementer_prompt.md`.
- Generated `memory/all_memories.md` aggregating every memory markdown entry with source annotations.

## Actions
- Confirmed memory sources reside under `memory/records/` and noted no `memory/ways/` entries to include.
- Wrote a consolidation script to stitch the ordered contents into `memory/all_memories.md`, skipping the target file to avoid recursion.

## Validation
- Counted 65 markdown inputs and confirmed the consolidated file includes 65 matching `<!-- Source: ... -->` markers.

## Follow-ups
- None.
