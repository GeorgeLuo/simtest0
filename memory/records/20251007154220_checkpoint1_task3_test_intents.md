# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint I Task 3

## Summary
- Added comment-oriented Jest specs capturing expectations for primitives:
  - `src/core/entity/__tests__/EntityManager.test.ts` outlines lifecycle intents (id uniqueness, removal semantics, list/has behaviors).
  - `src/core/components/__tests__/ComponentManager.test.ts` details component association rules and interactions with entity lifecycle.
- Each test file instantiates managers but defers assertions to Stage 3, embedding TODO notes.

## Validation
- `npm run test` executes both suites successfully (no assertions yet), confirming the scaffold compiles.

## Status
- Task 3 complete; Task 4 will convert these intents into executable tests.
