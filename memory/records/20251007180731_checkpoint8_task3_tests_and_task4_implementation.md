# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint VIII Tasks 3 & 4

## Summary
- Converted evaluation player placeholders into executable tests covering frame injection storage, condition management, and outbound publishing (`src/core/evalplayer/__tests__/EvaluationPlayer.test.ts`).
- Added operation tests ensuring acknowledgements and delegation to player hooks (`InjectFrameOperation.test.ts`, `RegisterConditionOperation.test.ts`, `RemoveConditionOperation.test.ts`).
- Implemented evaluation player logic:
  - `EvaluationPlayer` now tracks frames and conditions, uses inherited `publishFrame` to emit filtered frames.
  - Operations return success acknowledgements and call corresponding player methods.
- All Jest suites (47 tests) pass.

## Status
- Ready for Stage 5 validation (checks.sh) and subsequent task planning.
