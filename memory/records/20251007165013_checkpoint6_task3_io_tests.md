# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint VI Task 3

## Summary
- Replaced IO player placeholders with executable Jest tests:
  - `IOPlayer.test.ts` now verifies lifecycle delegation to `SystemManager`, frame filtering prior to outbound publication, and routing through the inbound handler registry.
  - Operation tests ensure `Start/Pause/Stop` invoke player lifecycle methods and return success acknowledgements with message ids.
  - Inject/Eject system operation tests validate delegation to player injection/ejection hooks returning acknowledgements.
- Tests currently fail due to Not implemented stubs in IOPlayer/operations, setting up Stage 4 implementation work.

## Validation
- `npm run test` fails with `Not implemented` errors from Start/Pause/Eject operations as expected.

## Status
- Task 3 complete; proceed to Task 4 to implement IOPlayer and operations.
