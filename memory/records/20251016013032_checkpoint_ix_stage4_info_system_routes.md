# Checkpoint IX Stage 4 â€“ Information & System Routes

- Filled out `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/routes/information.ts` to expose root discoverability metadata and serve spec/API markdown via the shared reader, including graceful error responses.
- Implemented `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/routes/system.ts` to surface health/status snapshots with error wrapping, matching the monitoring expectations.
- Confirmed behavior with `npx vitest run src/routes/__tests__/information.test.ts src/routes/__tests__/system.test.ts`, all assertions passing.
