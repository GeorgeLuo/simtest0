# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint IX Tasks 3 & 4

## Summary
- Converted integration outline into executable Jest test (`src/integration/__tests__/SimEvalIntegration.test.ts`) mocking players/buses and verifying `createServer` registers routes and returns a server instance.
- Implemented `createServer` in `src/server/bootstrap.ts` to assemble router with simulation/evaluation/codebase routes and instantiate the HTTP server wrapper.
- Updated simulation/evaluation routes to publish acknowledgements, stream SSE, and delegate to IO/Evaluation player hooks with concrete types.
- Codebase routes now proxy to dependency-provided `listDir`/`readFile` functions.
- All tests (48) pass after updates.

## Status
- Proceed to Stage 5 validation (`./checks.sh`) and planning for next checkpoint.
