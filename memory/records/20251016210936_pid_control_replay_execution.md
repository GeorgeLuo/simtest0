# PID Control Replay Execution â€“ 2025-10-16T21:09Z

- Adjusted `replay_pid_attempt.sh` for macOS portability (portable ISO timestamp helper, heredoc assignment, tolerant `run_cmd`).
- Successfully executed the script; outputs stored in `replays/pid_control/run-20251016-140911/`.
- Findings match third-party report: `/simulation/status` stuck at `tick:0`, SSE stream sends only keep-alive comment before timing out, `POST /simulation/system` returns `500` with missing handler error, evaluation remains `running:false`.
- Captured run artifacts: `replay.log` logging HTTP transcripts and `notes.txt` reiterating discrepancies.
