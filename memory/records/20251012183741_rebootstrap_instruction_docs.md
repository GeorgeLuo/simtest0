# Task Record — Re-bootstrap Instruction Documents (Implementer)

## Summary
- Copied the latest `Describing_Simulation_0.md` into `instruction_documents/` and regenerated all extracted section files to mirror the refreshed spec.
- Added the new `instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_api_map.md` slice and refreshed the table of contents so the API surface is discoverable.
- Updated mindset prompts and the instruction index to reference the API Map guidance required by the revised bootstrapping bullets.

## Validation
- Spot-checked regenerated files for the new API Map bullet in bootstraps and the API Map references in Implementer/Integrator/Aligner prompts.

## Follow-ups
- None — repositories outside instruction docs already carry broader spec updates.
