Added a counter plugin for module injection: defined `CounterStateComponent`, `CounterIncrementSystem` that provisions/increments the counter each tick, exposed via `createCounterSystems`, injected it through the HTTP API, observed `counter_state` growth in `/frames/latest`, and kept unit tests green (`npm test`).
