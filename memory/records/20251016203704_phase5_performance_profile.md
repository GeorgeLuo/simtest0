# Phase 5 Performance Profile

- Added `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/tools/profile_io_player.ts`, a CLI harness that spins up an `IOPlayer`, seeds entities/components, and measures pure `step()` throughput (configurable via env). Compiled with `tsc` to execute without modifying build config.
- Ran `node tmp_profile/tools/profile_io_player.js` with defaults (1 000 iterations, 500 entities, 5 components each); recorded output in `verifications/perf_profile_20251016T203646Z.json` showing ~18.1 M frames/sec (duration ≈ 0.055 ms) on the current optimized branch.
- No additional hotspots detected in this synthetic scenario; future profiling should incorporate real systems and outbound processing for end-to-end fidelity.
