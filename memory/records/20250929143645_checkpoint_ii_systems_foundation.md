# Checkpoint II Systems Foundation

- Added Vitest suites for system primitives and the system manager to verify lifecycle hooks, execution order, and scheduling.
- Implemented the `System` base class with default lifecycle hooks and scheduling identifiers.
- Implemented `SystemManager` to maintain ordered systems, coordinate lifecycle callbacks, and execute updates each tick.
- Confirmed the full test suite passes through `./checks.sh`.
