# Checkpoint IX Stage 4 â€“ Simulation & Evaluation Routes

- Implemented HTTP handlers in `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/routes/simulation.ts` and `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/routes/evaluation.ts`, wiring POST/DELETE endpoints to publish bus messages with acknowledgement timeouts and framing payload helpers, plus SSE streaming for outbound frames.
- Added shared utilities in `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/routes/helpers.ts` to manage acknowledgement waits and Server-Sent Events (including keep-alive and cleanup hooks).
- Verified route behavior via `npx vitest run src/routes/__tests__/simulation.test.ts src/routes/__tests__/evaluation.test.ts`, all six assertions passing.
