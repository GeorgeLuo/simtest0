# Phase 4 Behavioral Alignment Sweep

- Enumerated the active HTTP surface by instantiating `createServer()` (post-build) and inspecting `router.getRoutes()`, confirming all 22 endpoints match the API map â€” root discovery, informational markdown, simulation/evaluation controls, codebase utilities, and health/status.
- Verified acknowledgement semantics and SSE wiring via existing Vitest suites (`npx vitest run` as part of `./checks.sh --integration`), ensuring lifecycle commands resolve to acknowledgement payloads and stream handlers broadcast frames on the expected event names (`simulation`, `evaluation`).
- Exercised the end-to-end workflow again with `./checks.sh --integration`, producing `verifications/checks_20251016T202046Z.log` and integration artifacts under `verifications/integration_20251016T132048/`, validating documentation endpoints, plugin uploads to `plugins/simulation/...`, simulation start acknowledgements, and evaluation SSE output.
- No deviations from the API map observed; no exceptions recorded. Phase 4 behavioral alignment is ready for handoff to subsequent phases.
