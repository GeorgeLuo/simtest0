# Checkpoint VIII Stage 4 Implementation

- Implemented frame ingestion in `src/core/evalplayer/EvaluationPlayer.ts`, creating entities for each frame and storing data under `EVALUATION_FRAME_COMPONENT`.
- Added outbound publishing of filtered frames and wired the inbound registry with `InjectFrameOperation` through a `MessageHandler`.
- Updated `InjectFrameOperation` to validate payloads and delegate ingestion, plus exposed `IOPlayer` filter/outbound members for subclass use.
