# Bootstrap Refresh

## Summary
- Re-segmented `Describing_Simulation_0.md` into instruction documents reflecting the latest structure, including the new outsider integration excerpt.
- Updated mindset prompts to swap in packager and outsider guidance and removed the deprecated integrator prompt.
- Regenerated the table of contents and indices so discoverability matches the revised document set.
- Added a placeholder `tools/start.sh` to satisfy the repository structure, with a note to implement launch behavior later.

## Follow-ups
- Implement the actual simulator start procedure inside `tools/start.sh` once the runtime exists.
