# Task Record — Remove stale verification way (implementer)

## Summary
- Removed the outdated verification-layer ways entry after superseding it with the dev-tools path guidance.

## Actions
- Deleted `memory/ways/verification_layers_for_change_management.md` to avoid conflicting instructions with `memory/ways/verification_layers_for_change_management_dev_tools.md`.

## Validation
- Not run (memory-only change).

## Done-ness Evaluation
- Ways guidance now points to the current `tools/dev` verification paths without a conflicting legacy file.
