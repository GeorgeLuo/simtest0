# Phase 3 Integration – Attempt 2025-10-16T11:37Z

- Ran `./tools/run_integration.sh`; build succeeded but the server failed to boot, preventing `/health` from responding within the 30-attempt window.
- Server log captured under `verifications/integration_20251016T113712/server.log` shows Node’s ESM loader rejecting `import "./server/Server"` due to missing `.js` extension in the compiled output (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).
- Issue reproduces when running `node dist/main.js` manually, indicating the TypeScript build emits ESM without specifier extensions; Node 24 requires explicit `.js` suffixes or alternative module resolution (`node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node` did not resolve it).
- Next step: implementer should adjust the build to produce runtime-compatible modules (e.g., add `.js` extensions to relative imports or switch to NodeNext resolution) and then rerun the integration script.
