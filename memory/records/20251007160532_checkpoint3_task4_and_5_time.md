# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint III Tasks 4 & 5

## Summary
- Implemented `TimeComponent.validate` to accept non-negative integer ticks and reject invalid payloads.
- Implemented `TimeSystem` to create a dedicated time entity on initialization and increment the tick component each update, falling back to initialization if update is invoked first.
- All time-related Jest suites now pass (18 tests overall), and repository checks (`./checks.sh`) remain green.
- Appended verification log entry at `verifications/20251007T154720_checks.log`.

## Status
- Phase 2 Checkpoint III complete. Ready for Tasker to scope Checkpoint IV (Orchestration).
