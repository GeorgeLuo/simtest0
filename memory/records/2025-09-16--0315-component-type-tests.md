## Context
Converted the ComponentType test intents into executable Vitest suites to check the metadata contract and factory behavior for ECS components.

## Findings
- Added concrete tests that assert the component schema metadata exposes descriptions and default values for each field.
- Exercised a component factory helper to confirm it merges defaults with overrides without mutating stored defaults.
- Introduced the initial ComponentType builder implementation so the new tests have a subject under test.

## Next steps
- Extend the remaining ECS primitives with similar test coverage as their intents are codified.
- Flesh out ComponentManager and Entity primitives so they satisfy future tests driven by the new contract.
