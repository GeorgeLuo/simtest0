# Task Record — Phase 4 Alignment Refresh

## Summary
- Re-ran the Phase 4 structural checklist against `instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md`; all core scaffolding files (`entity`, `components`, `systems`, messaging helpers, IO/evaluation players, operations, routes, server bootstrap, documentation) remain present and aligned with their described responsibilities.
- Confirmed the simulation/evaluation server wiring stays in sync with the spec after recent optimizer work: `IOPlayer` still exposes the expected playback contract, `InjectSystemOperation` and peers are implemented, and `main.ts` continues to surface the `cycleIntervalMs` tuning without regressing default cadence.
- Removed the redundant root-level `src/` directory (duplicate of the workspace tree) so the published repository now mirrors the spec’s single-source workspace layout.

## Validation
- `npm test` (within `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/`)
- `./checks.sh`
- `./tools/run_integration.sh`

## Artifacts
- Integration rerun captured `verifications/20251009T182750_integration.json`, confirming the temperature-control scenario still exercises injection, playback, and SSE capture successfully.

## Follow-ups
- None.
