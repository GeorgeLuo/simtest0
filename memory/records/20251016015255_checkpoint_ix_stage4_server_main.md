# Checkpoint IX Stage 4 â€“ Server & Entrypoint Wiring

- Implemented HTTP lifecycle in `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/server/Server.ts`, covering guarded `listen`/`close`, idempotent start/stop, and disposal/cleanup hooks.
- Wired `createServer` in `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/main.ts` to build simulation/evaluation players, bridge frame streams, register all route modules (information, simulation, evaluation, codebase, system), and expose metadata/doc paths.
- Added dynamic `main()` startup that defers to the (mockable) exported factory, enabling Vitest spies while starting the server with the constructed dependencies.
- Validated with `npx vitest run src/server/__tests__/Server.test.ts src/main.test.ts` and a full `npx vitest run`, followed by `npm run build`.
