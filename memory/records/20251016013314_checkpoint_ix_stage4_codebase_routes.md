# Checkpoint IX Stage 4 â€“ Codebase Routes

- Completed `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/routes/codebase.ts`, adding tree enumeration, file retrieval, and guarded plugin upload handlers with relative-path sanitization to prevent directory traversal.
- Introduced shared helpers to normalize/sanitize plugin paths and ensure empty or absolute paths are rejected.
- Validated via `npx vitest run src/routes/__tests__/codebase.test.ts` and `npm run build`, both succeeding.
