# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint VI Tasks 4 & 5

## Summary
- Implemented IO Player lifecycle and messaging integration:
  - Manages inbound subscription, periodic system manager cycles, pause/stop handling, and frame publication via `FrameFilter` and outbound bus.
  - Added injection/ejection hooks delegating to `SystemManager`.
- Implemented start/pause/stop/inject/eject operation classes returning acknowledgements and delegating to the player hooks.
- Expanded messaging generics to support arbitrary contexts for operations/handlers.
- All Jest suites now green (36 tests) and `./checks.sh` logs `20251007T165356 - checks.sh pass (IO Player)`.
