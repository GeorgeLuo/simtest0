# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint II Task 2

## Summary
- Created `src/core/systems/__tests__/System.test.ts` with comment-only placeholders describing lifecycle expectations (abstract `update`, optional hooks, lifecycle order, context usage).
- Maintained TODOs for Stage 3 conversion to executable assertions.

## Validation
- `npm run test` continues to pass (Suite count includes placeholder test).

## Status
- Task 2 complete; move to Task 3 to implement concrete system lifecycle tests.
