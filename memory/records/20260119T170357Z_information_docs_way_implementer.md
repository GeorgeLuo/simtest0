# Task Record — Information doc serving way (implementer)

## Summary
- Added a ways memory describing how informational markdown is served and when changes are picked up.

## Actions
- Created `memory/ways/information_docs_serving.md` to document runtime file reads, startup-only cataloging, and the manual sync requirement between root and instruction copies of `Describing_Simulation_0.md`.

## Validation
- Not run (documentation-only change).

## Done-ness Evaluation
- Serving behavior is now captured in a durable ways memory for future reference.
