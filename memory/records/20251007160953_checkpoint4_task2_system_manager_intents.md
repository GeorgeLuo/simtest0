# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint IV Task 2

## Summary
- Added comment-only spec `src/core/systems/__tests__/SystemManager.test.ts` capturing expectations for system registration, lifecycle hooks, execution order, and context exposure.
- Tests compile without assertions, awaiting Stage 3 conversion.

## Validation
- `npm run test` remains green with placeholder test suite.

## Status
- Task 2 complete; next step is to codify the orchestration tests in Stage 3.
