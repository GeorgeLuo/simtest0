# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint III Task 3

## Summary
- Converted time component/system test intents into executable Jest suites.
  - `TimeComponent.test.ts` now verifies validation of integer ticks and metadata stability.
  - `TimeSystem.test.ts` introduces mocks for entity/component managers to assert initialization and tick increments.
- Tests currently fail due to `Not implemented` placeholders in `TimeComponent` and `TimeSystem`, preparing for Stage 4 implementation.

## Validation
- `npm run test` fails with expected `Not implemented` errors, confirming coverage reaches the skeleton methods.

## Status
- Task 3 complete; proceed to Task 4 to implement time component/system logic.
