# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint VII Tasks 4 & 5

## Summary
- Implemented routing and server behaviors:
  - `Router` now stores handlers, normalizes base paths, and dispatches requests.
  - Simulation routes expose start/pause/stop/inject/eject and SSE stream endpoints, returning success acknowledgements.
  - Evaluation routes support frame injection and system control, returning acknowledgements and streaming events.
  - Codebase routes proxy to dependency-provided directory and file readers.
  - `Server` wraps Node http server, dispatching to the router and handling 404 responses.
- Added concrete Jest tests for router, routes, and server; all 42 tests pass.
- Verification log updated (`20251007T170406 - checks.sh pass (Server & Routes)`).

## Status
- Checkpoint VII complete. Tasker to scope Checkpoint VIII (Evaluation Player).
