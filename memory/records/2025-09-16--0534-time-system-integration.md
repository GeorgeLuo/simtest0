## Context
Integrated the TimeSystem with the ECS managers so temporal state is persisted via
a component rather than internal counters.

## Findings
- Updated the TimeSystem to depend on the shared EntityManager and
  ComponentManager, creating a dedicated entity that carries the registered time
  component.
- Ensured each update step reads the component back and increments ticks by its
  configured `deltaPerUpdate`, keeping the system's accessors in sync with ECS
  state.
- Added Vitest coverage validating that the entity/component are created during
  construction and that ticks advance across multiple updates.

## Next steps
- Expand system coverage as additional simulation behaviors depend on shared
  components.
- Consider surfacing the time entity identifier for orchestration layers that
  might need to reference it explicitly.
