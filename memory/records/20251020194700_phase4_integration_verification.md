# Phase 4 Integration â€“ Verification 2025-10-20T19:47Z

- Executed `./tools/run_integration.sh` to exercise the six-step harness; build, startup, discovery, status validation, plugin uploads, and evaluation streaming all completed without intervention.
- Artifacts captured under `verifications/integration_20251020T124621/`, including documentation responses, codebase snapshots, plugin payloads, SSE transcript, and server log.
- The server automatically stopped via the trap handler and the resulting logs show a clean run, confirming the integration workflow remains repeatable for future validation.
