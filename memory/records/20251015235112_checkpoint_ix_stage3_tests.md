# Checkpoint IX Stage 3 Tests

- Codified Vitest suites validating router dispatch, route handlers (simulation, evaluation, codebase, information, system), server lifecycle, and entrypoint orchestration under `src/main.test.ts` and `src/routes/__tests__`, `src/server/__tests__`.
- Added SSE, acknowledgement, and filesystem expectations to drive upcoming implementation; tests currently fail against stubbed modules (`npm test` shows 29 failing cases) as intended.
- Brought in `@types/node` dev dependency to support Node HTTP/filesystem typing for the new suites.
