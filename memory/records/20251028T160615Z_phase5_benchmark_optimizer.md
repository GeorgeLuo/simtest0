# Phase 5 Benchmark â€” Optimizer

- Installed workspace dependencies and rebuilt TypeScript output to ensure dist artifacts existed for the benchmark harness.
- Ran `node tools/benchmark_simulation.js` to capture 500 ticks of runtime data from the baseline temperature control system.
- Stored metrics in `verifications/20251028T160600_benchmark.json` for future optimization comparisons.
