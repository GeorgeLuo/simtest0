# Task Record — Phase 4 Alignment Refresh

## Summary
- Re-ran structural alignment per `instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md` using the post-optimization codebase.
- Confirmed all core scaffolding files remain in place (`Entity*`, `Component*`, `System*`, messaging buses/filters, players, operations) with implementations matching their spec roles.
- Verified prior gap (`InjectSystemOperation`) is now implemented, and the new `cycleIntervalMs` option in `src/main.ts` preserves the default 50 ms cadence while enabling fast-cycle benchmarking in compliance with the spec.
- Noted unchanged variance: evaluation plugin scaffolding under `plugins/evaluation/` remains todo per spec’s future-work guidance.

## Follow-ups
- Populate exemplar evaluation plugins when the spec advances to that stage; no immediate blockers for current alignment scope.
