# Task Record — Phase 4 Task 1 (Structural Audit)

Reviewed the implemented workspace against the structure described in `instruction_documents/Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md` and Phase 4 guidance.

## Expected vs Actual Matrix

| Area | Expected Artifact(s) | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core › Entity | `Entity.ts`, `EntityManager.ts` | ✅ Present | Entity manager fully implemented with lifecycle helpers. |
| Core › Components | `ComponentType.ts`, `ComponentManager.ts`, `TimeComponent.ts` | ✅ Present | Matches spec; ComponentManager wired into IOPlayer snapshots. |
| Core › Systems | `System.ts`, `SystemManager.ts`, `TimeSystem.ts` | ✅ Present | TimeSystem implemented; additional helper methods align with spec. |
| Core › Messaging (bus/inbound/outbound) | `Bus.ts`, inbound/outbound helpers | ✅ Present | JSON routing relies on these; tests cover handlers/ack frames. |
| Core › Simulation Player | `IOPlayer.ts`, operations (`Start`, `Pause`, `Stop`, `InjectSystem`, `EjectSystem`) | ⚠️ Partial | `InjectSystemOperation.execute` still throws `Not implemented`; needs implementation before final validation. |
| Core › Evaluation Player | `EvaluationPlayer.ts`, operations (`InjectFrame`, `RegisterCondition`, `RemoveCondition`) | ✅ Present | All operations implemented; coverage verifies storage and acknowledgements. |
| Routes | `router.ts`, `simulation.ts`, `evaluation.ts`, `codebase.ts`, `information.ts` | ✅ Present | Router enhanced with JSON parsing per Phase 3; information routes align with docs. |
| Server | `server/index.ts`, `server/bootstrap.ts`, `main.ts` | ✅ Present | Bootstrap wires players, loaders, information segments. |
| Integration Harness | `src/integration/__tests__/SimEvalIntegration.test.ts`, `tools/run_integration.*` | ✅ Present | Test mocks route registration; runner emits verification artifact. |
| Plugins | `plugins/simulation/temperatureControlSystem.js` | ⚠️ Partial | Simulation plugin provided; evaluation plugin directory still absent (per spec, future work). |
| Documentation & Tooling | `routes/information/*.md`, `tools/index.md`, workspace README | ✅ Present | Content reflects latest workflow; Task 3 will double-check narrative alignment. |

## Discrepancies & TODOs

- **Simulation Inject Operation** — Implementation outstanding (`src/core/simplayer/operations/InjectSystemOperation.ts`). Behavioral validation should either stub expectations or complete logic.
- **Evaluation Plugins** — Spec references `plugins/evaluation/...`; current workspace lacks example assets. Not a blocker but worth noting for completeness.
- **Legacy tests** — All placeholder tests replaced except Inject operation; no further structural TODO markers detected.

No additional missing files were identified. Proceeding to Task 2 (behavioral verification sweep).
