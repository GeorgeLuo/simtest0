# Workspace Bootstrap â€“ Initial ECS Scaffolding

## Summary
- Captured baseline architectural guidance immediately after repository bootstrap so that future workspace automation can converge on a consistent ECS implementation.
- Recorded the initial set of "ways" and "records" memories to satisfy the bootstrapping workflow described for Simulation 0.

## ECS scaffolding decisions
- Adopted the ECS directory layout enumerated in the codifying instructions (entity, component, system, messaging, evaluator, routes, and server layers) as the canonical starting point for the workspace.
- Reserved plugin subdirectories within components, systems, messaging handlers, condition evaluators, and routes to isolate agent-authored behavior from shared scaffolding.
- Confirmed that scaffolding must ship with a condition evaluator, metrics aggregation and query surfaces, and real-time control endpoints so that subsequent agents can focus on domain plugins rather than infrastructure.
