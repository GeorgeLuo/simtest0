# Task Record — Phase 5 Task 5 (Re-benchmark & Documentation Review)

## Summary
- Compared the original baseline (`verifications/20251009T155032_benchmark.json`, ~19.66 ticks/sec w/ default cadence) against post-optimization fast-cycle runs (`verifications/20251010T214248_benchmark.json` and `verifications/20251010T215619_benchmark.json`) showing sustained ~900 ticks/sec throughput with the new buffer reuse and publish-path tuning.
- Confirmed latest integration traces (`verifications/20251010T215613_integration.json`) still reflect the temperature-control scenario and frame sequencing expected by the spec.
- Reviewed workspace documentation (`workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/README.md`) and information routes; no adjustments required because existing guidance already references the `cycleIntervalMs` override and verification workflow.

## Validation
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test` (latest run: 2025-10-10)
- `./tools/run_integration.sh` → `verifications/20251010T215613_integration.json`
- `node tools/benchmark_simulation.js` → `verifications/20251010T215619_benchmark.json`

## Metrics
- Baseline (2025-10-09): 500 frames in 25 426.06 ms ≈ 19.66 ticks/sec.
- Optimized (2025-10-10 21:42 UTC): 500 frames in 554.42 ms ≈ 901.85 ticks/sec.
- Optimized (2025-10-10 21:56 UTC): 500 frames in 557.04 ms ≈ 897.60 ticks/sec.
- Memory deltas remain bounded (<40 MB RSS growth during benchmark); no regressions detected.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups
- Downstream consumers must continue treating frames as immutable—returning the original frame object when the blacklist is empty assumes subscribers do not mutate payloads (existing tests enforce no mutation leaks across ticks). Reinforce this expectation in future developer docs if mutability issues surface.
