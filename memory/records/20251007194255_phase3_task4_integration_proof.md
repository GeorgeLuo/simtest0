# Task Record â€” Phase 3 Task 4 (Execute & Capture Integration Proof)

## Summary
- Enhanced IOPlayer to emit frame snapshots each tick, deriving entity/component payloads from the system manager while tracking tick counters; added snapshot tests to confirm frame publication cadence.
- Expanded router capabilities to parse JSON bodies, attach query params, and provide `res.json`, enabling the integration harness to interact with HTTP endpoints; verified behavior with new unit coverage.
- Hardened SSE endpoints with header flushing and authored a simulation plugin (temperature control) plus automation script updates to start the server, monitor streams, and exercise playback controls end-to-end.
- Captured live SSE output for simulation and evaluation players, persisting a proof artifact (`verifications/20251008T022702_integration.json`) demonstrating temperature stabilization behavior.

## Validation
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test`
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 run build`
- `./tools/run_integration.sh`

## Status
- Phase 3 integration test complete with recorded evidence. Ready to transition towards Phase 4 validation planning.
