# Phase 2 Checkpoint IX Stage 4 â€“ Information Artifacts

- Replaced the placeholders under `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/information/Api.md` and `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/information/Describing_Simulation.md` with curated documentation sourced from the API map, codifying simulations brief, and integration workflow notes.
- Documented acknowledgement semantics, streaming behaviour, and endpoint-by-endpoint guidance so `/information/api.md` mirrors the active HTTP surface.
- Summarised the sim-eval methodology, runtime players, messaging architecture, and integration stages for `/information/Describing_Simulation.md`, reinforcing alignment goals for Phase 4.
- Validated the updates with `npx vitest run src/routes/__tests__/information.test.ts` to confirm the information routes continue to serve content successfully.
