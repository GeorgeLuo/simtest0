# Task Record â€” Phase 3 Task 2 (Surface API Usage)

## Summary
- Authored discoverability documentation under `src/routes/information/` (`api.md` and `Describing_Simulation.md`) to orient first-time operators.
- Implemented `registerInformationRoutes` to expose `/api`, `/api/information`, and per-document endpoints, returning segment metadata and markdown content through the router.
- Wired information routes into the server bootstrap and runtime start sequence with curated segment/document metadata sourced from the workspace.
- Expanded integration coverage to assert information route registration and added dedicated Jest tests for the new endpoints; refreshed the workspace README to flag the API landing page.

## Validation
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test`
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 run build`

## Status
- Task complete. Continue with Phase 3 Task 3 (Automate injection workflow) per the task queue.
