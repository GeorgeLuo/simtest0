# Checkpoint X Server Scaffold

- Added API route tests and SSE handler tests to validate server wiring without binding sockets.
- Implemented server environment, SSE utilities, and HTTP handler routing playback controls and evaluation injection requests.
- Created `pipeFrames` integration adapter that auto-emits evaluation frames upon injection and exposed the node server creation entry point.
- Test suite passes via `./checks.sh`.
