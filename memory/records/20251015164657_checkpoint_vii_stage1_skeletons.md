# Checkpoint VII Stage 1 Skeletons

- Created `src/core/simplayer/SimulationPlayer.ts` with playback message constants and constructor wiring for a future handler registration hook.
- Stubbed `Start`, `Pause`, and `Stop` operation classes under `src/core/simplayer/operations/`, exporting message identifiers aligned to `simulation.<action>`.
- Ran `npm run build` to ensure the new skeletons compile cleanly; TypeScript passes.
