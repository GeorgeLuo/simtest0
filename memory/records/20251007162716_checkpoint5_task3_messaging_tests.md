# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint V Task 3

## Summary
- Converted messaging test intents into executable Jest suites:
  - `Bus.test.ts` validates subscription order and unsubscribe behavior.
  - `FrameFilter.test.ts` ensures blacklisted components are removed without mutating original frame.
  - `Acknowledgement.test.ts` documents success/error shapes.
  - `Operation.test.ts` confirms execute contract.
  - `MessageHandler.test.ts` asserts sequential operation execution with shared context.
  - `InboundHandlerRegistry.test.ts` verifies handler routing and unknown type handling.
- Tests currently fail due to Not implemented messaging skeleton methods, preparing for Stage 4.

## Validation
- `npm run test` fails with expected `Not implemented` errors from Bus, FrameFilter, MessageHandler, and InboundHandlerRegistry.

## Status
- Task 3 complete; proceed to Task 4 to implement messaging components.
