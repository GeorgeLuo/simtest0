# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint I Task 1

## Summary
- Bootstrapped Node.js/TypeScript project under `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/` with strict compiler settings (`tsconfig.json`) and Jest via `ts-jest` (`jest.config.js`).
- Added project scripts in `package.json` for `build`, `test`, `test:watch`, and `clean`; installed dev dependencies (`typescript`, `ts-node`, `jest`, `ts-jest`, `@types/*`).
- Seeded directory structure with `src/core/entity/` and `src/core/components/` placeholder files awaiting Stage 1 skeleton implementation.
- Enhanced workspace README to document environment setup, reference instruction documents, and note upcoming wiring of `checks.sh`.

## Validation
- `npm run build` and `npm run test` executed successfully (no tests yet, allowed via Jest config `passWithNoTests`).
- Confirmed `package-lock.json` generated and retained in workspace.

## Status
- Task 1 complete. Proceed to Task 2 (Checkpoint I Stage 1 skeletons) as the next Implementer action.
