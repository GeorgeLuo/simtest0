# Phase 4 Validation Checkpoint
- Mapped expected scaffold per codifying doc; core ECS files present but key directories diverge (missing `src/core/simplayer/*`, `src/core/evalplayer/*`, plugin tree, workspace README).
- Confirmed existing implementations reuse `IOPlayer` for both simulation/evaluation flows; no dedicated evaluation frame injection (`InjectFrame.ts`) found.
- `npm test` passes (65 tests).
- `tools/run_integration.sh` fails: evaluation snapshot load returns tick 19 versus saved tick 9 because `loadEvaluationSnapshot` restarts the evaluation loop and advances time before verification.
- Artifacts captured under `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/verifications/20251002T052622Z/`.
