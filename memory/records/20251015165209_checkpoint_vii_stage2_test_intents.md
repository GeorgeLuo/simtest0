# Checkpoint VII Stage 2 Test Intents

- Authored comment-only Vitest specs outlining expectations for SimulationPlayer handler registration and acknowledgement flow in `src/core/simplayer/__tests__/SimulationPlayer.test.ts`.
- Captured operation-level intents to assert lifecycle delegation and success acknowledgements in `src/core/simplayer/operations/__tests__/{Start,Pause,Stop}.test.ts`.
- Verified files remain non-executable, preserving the TDD cadence ahead of Stage 3 test implementation.
