# Task Record — Phase 5 Task 4 (Frame Snapshot Allocation Reduction)

## Summary
- Reworked `IOPlayer` snapshotting to reuse internal buffers instead of allocating new arrays each tick, leveraging `EntityManager.forEach` and the new `ComponentManager.collectComponents` helper to iterate without intermediate copies.
- Converted `ComponentManager` and `EntityManager` to expose non-allocating traversal APIs, enabling reuse across other hot paths.
- Adjusted `FrameFilter` to short-circuit when no blacklist is provided, eliminating unnecessary object cloning on the publish path, and added guard coverage in `FrameFilter.test.ts`.
- Strengthened `IOPlayer` tests to assert per-tick frame objects are distinct and mutations do not leak across ticks.

## Validation
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test`
- `./tools/run_integration.sh`
- `node tools/benchmark_simulation.js`

## Artifacts
- Integration snapshot: `verifications/20251010T215613_integration.json`
- Benchmark snapshot: `verifications/20251010T215619_benchmark.json` (500 frames in 557.04 ms, ≈897.60 ticks/sec)
