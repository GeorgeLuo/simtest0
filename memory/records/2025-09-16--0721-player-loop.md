## Context
Implemented the base simulation player to drive the ECS systems and codified the dormant Player test intents into executable Vitest suites.

## Findings
- Added a Player class that owns the component, entity, and system managers, exposes start/pause/stop controls, and manages a timed update loop with configurable delta handling.
- Ensured the loop schedules sequential updates, respects pause and stop transitions, and triggers system lifecycle hooks alongside entity cleanup on stop.
- Converted the Player test outline into concrete Vitest cases covering initial start, pause/resume behavior, and shutdown/reset expectations.

## Next steps
- Integrate the Player with forthcoming IO bus handlers once those specifications are codified.
- Consider providing explicit elapsed-time reset support in SystemManager so future stop cycles can zero accumulated time without reinstantiating managers.
