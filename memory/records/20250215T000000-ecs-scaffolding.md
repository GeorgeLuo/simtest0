- Set up initial ECS scaffolding under `project/src/ecs/` with entity, entity manager, component type, and component manager implementations.
- Added custom TypeScript test harness and tests covering entity creation/removal and component attachment/query semantics.
- Configured project TypeScript build and npm scripts to compile and execute the new test suite without external dependencies.
