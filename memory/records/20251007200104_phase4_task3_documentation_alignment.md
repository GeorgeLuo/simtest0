# Task Record â€” Phase 4 Task 3 (Documentation Consistency Review)

## Summary
- Refreshed workspace README to reference the API landing JSON, up-to-date task queues, and integration tooling alongside `./checks.sh`.
- Confirmed `routes/information/api.md`, `routes/information/Describing_Simulation.md`, and `tools/index.md` accurately describe the current server surface and integration workflow; no changes required beyond the README update.
- Verified integration runner script documents the five automation steps and now captures SSE artifacts tied to verifications.

## Observations
- Information markdown reflects core ECS concepts and upload workflow; future evaluation plugins can be linked once available.
- README still references pending InjectSystemOperation completion (captured in structural audit) as part of overall TODO awareness.

## Status
- Documentation alignment complete. Phase 4 structural & behavioral validation tasks concluded; ready to plan next steps (Phase 5 or Inject operation follow-up).
