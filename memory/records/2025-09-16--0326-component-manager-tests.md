## Context
Translated the ComponentManager test intentions into executable Vitest cases and
implemented the supporting logic needed for them to pass.

## Findings
- Added registration, attachment, and update propagation tests covering the
  ComponentManager workflow.
- Implemented ComponentType metadata and a ComponentManager registry so the new
  tests exercise real behavior.
- `npm test` now executes the suite successfully with the new specifications.

## Next steps
- Flesh out tests for the remaining ECS primitives once their specifications are
  ready.
- Extend the manager APIs with removal semantics or iteration helpers as future
  requirements clarify.
