# Validate start script (packager)

## Context
- Verified the newly added `tools/start.sh` aligns with Phase 3 packaging expectations and provides an easy bring-up path.

## Runbook
- Ensured workspace README references the root `./tools/start.sh` helper.
- Executed `./tools/start.sh`; observed dependency install, successful launch message, and log/PID artifacts in `verifications/`.
- Terminated the service via recorded PID to confirm cleanup flow.

## Observations
- Log written to `verifications/simeval_start_20251028T173826Z.log`; the PID file remains for traceability after manual shutdown.
- Initial run installs dependencies; subsequent runs will reuse `node_modules/`.

## Follow-up
- Optional: add a companion stop script if future workflows prefer automated teardown.
- Confirm external documentation references the log/PID convention when onboarding new users.
