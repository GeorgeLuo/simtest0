# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint II Task 3

## Summary
- Replaced placeholder lifecycle spec with executable assertions in `src/core/systems/__tests__/System.test.ts`.
  - Validates hook invocation order using a concrete subclass.
  - Ensures initialize/destroy default to no-ops for subclasses that only override `update`.
- Tests currently fail (as expected) because `System.initialize`/`destroy` throw `Not implemented` pending Stage 4 implementation.

## Validation
- `npm run test` fails with the intended error, confirming coverage reaches unimplemented hooks.

## Status
- Task 3 complete; proceed with Task 4 to implement `System` hooks and satisfy tests.
