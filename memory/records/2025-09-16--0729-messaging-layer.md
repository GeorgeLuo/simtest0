## Context
Expanded the Describing Simulation 0 workspace to include the messaging
infrastructure sketched in the orientation documents. The goal was to build out
command handlers, an IO-aware player, and regression coverage before future
service layers depend on them.

## Findings
- Introduced a generic bus, message abstractions, and handlers for start,
  pause, stop, and entity injection commands while defining acknowledgement and
  frame message formats.
- Implemented an `IOPlayer` that extends the base player to process inbound
  commands, emit acknowledgements, and stream frames on every tick.
- Added Vitest suites that exercise command routing, entity injection,
  acknowledgement outcomes, and frame emission control when pausing.
- Updated `checks.sh` so contributors can run the new messaging tests directly
  alongside the full workspace suite.

## Next steps
- Layer additional inbound/outbound handlers as new simulation controls are
  specified.
- Integrate the IO player with higher-level service routes once those modules
  come online.
- Consider snapshot compression or diffing once frame payloads become large.
