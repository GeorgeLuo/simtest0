# Checkpoint VIII Stage 1 Skeletons

- Scaffolded Evaluation Player under `src/core/evalplayer/EvaluationPlayer.ts`, adding the `evaluation.frame` message constant, an exported frame component type, constructor wiring into the inbound registry, and placeholders for frame ingestion and publishing logic.
- Stubbed `InjectFrame` operation with payload typing and exported message identifier in `src/core/evalplayer/operations/InjectFrame.ts`, ready to delegate to the evaluation player once implemented.
- Introduced an acknowledgement type guard in `src/core/simplayer/__tests__/SimulationPlayer.test.ts` to keep existing suites compatible with strict TypeScript checks after the new files were added.
- Verified skeletons compile via `npm run build`.
