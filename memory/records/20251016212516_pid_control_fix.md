# PID Control Fix Verification â€“ 2025-10-16T21:25Z

- Extended the simulation core so `SystemManager` accepts explicit IDs and `SimulationPlayer` runs an internal tick loop with the core `TimeSystem` plus new inbound handlers for `simulation.system.inject/eject`.
- Added dynamic module loading that enforces the plugin directory sandbox and instantiates exported system classes before registering them.
- Updated unit tests to cover explicit IDs, module injection, and macOS-friendly replay scripting; `npm run build` and `npm test` both pass.
- Replayed PID script successfully: SSE frames stream on `/simulation/stream`, tick counter advanced to 50, and injecting `simulation/systems/PIDControlSystem.js` returned HTTP 200 (ack success).
