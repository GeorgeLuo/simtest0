# Task Record â€” Phase 1 Bootstrapping Checkpoint 2

## Summary
- Authored `instruction_documents/index.md` consolidating extracted files with concise summaries and a pointer to the table of contents.
- Created `instruction_documents/mindset_prompts/index.md` to describe each mindset prompt and indicate the parent reference.
- Introduced `AGENTS.md` at repository root to direct contributors to both indexes before beginning work and to keep edits within the extracted instruction set.

## Validation
- Each new document references `Describing_Simulation_0.md` as the source of truth, fulfilling Bootstraps discoverability requirements.
- Confirmed indexes enumerate all relevant files currently present in their directories.

## Status
- Checkpoint 2 complete; proceed to Checkpoint 3 (Repository Scaffolding Utilities) from the task queue.
