# Checkpoint IX Stage 4 â€“ Router Implementation

- Implemented full HTTP router in `workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0/src/routes/router.ts`, adding immutable route registration, path parameter matching, query parsing, optional JSON body parsing, and centralized JSON response helpers (404/500 handling while preserving streaming handlers).
- Ensured Server-Sent Event handlers remain open by only finalizing responses when handlers return a payload, and guarded header inspection for test doubles lacking `getHeader`.
- Verified behavior with `npx vitest run src/routes/__tests__/router.test.ts`, confirming all five router tests now pass.
