# Checkpoint VIII Stage 2 Test Intents

- Drafted comment-only specs for EvaluationPlayer outlining handler registration, frame persistence, outbound filtering, and acknowledgement expectations in `src/core/evalplayer/__tests__/EvaluationPlayer.test.ts`.
- Captured InjectFrame operation intents describing frame ingestion delegation and acknowledgement behavior in `src/core/evalplayer/operations/__tests__/InjectFrame.test.ts`.
- Confirmed files remain non-executable to preserve the TDD workflow ahead of Stage 3 test implementation.
