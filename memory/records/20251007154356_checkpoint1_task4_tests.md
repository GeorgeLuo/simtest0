# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint I Task 4

## Summary
- Converted test intents into executable Jest suites:
  - `src/core/entity/__tests__/EntityManager.test.ts` now asserts unique id allocation, lifecycle transitions, remove semantics, and list consistency.
  - `src/core/components/__tests__/ComponentManager.test.ts` covers component add/replace/remove behaviors, retrieval helpers, and entity association queries.
- Introduced small helpers for manager setup and mock component types to streamline assertions.

## Validation
- `npm run test` executed with expected failures (EntityManager/ComponentManager methods throw `Not implemented`), confirming tests exercise unimplemented paths.

## Status
- Task 4 complete. Proceed to Task 5 to implement primitives satisfying these tests.
