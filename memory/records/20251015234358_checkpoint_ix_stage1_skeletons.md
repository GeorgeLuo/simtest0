# Checkpoint IX Stage 1 Skeletons

- Added service entrypoint and factory placeholders in `src/main.ts`, stubbing `main` and `createServer` pending full bootstrap logic.
- Introduced `Server` scaffold in `src/server/Server.ts` exposing configuration accessors and lifecycle methods with TODO hooks.
- Established router contracts and individual route modules (`src/routes/*.ts`) with path constants for simulation, evaluation, codebase, information, and system API segments.
- Created informational markdown placeholders under `src/information/Api.md` and `src/information/Describing_Simulation.md` referencing canonical instruction sources.
- Verified the workspace compiles via `npm run build`, confirming skeleton additions integrate cleanly.
