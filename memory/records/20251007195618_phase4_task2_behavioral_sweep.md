# Task Record — Phase 4 Task 2 (Behavioral Verification Sweep)

## Summary
- Re-ran the full regression suite: `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test`, `./checks.sh`, and the integration harness (`./tools/run_integration.sh`). All executions succeeded without regressions.
- Integration run generated fresh stream artifacts (`verifications/20251008T052837_integration.json`) demonstrating temperature stabilization: simulation stream ticks 1–5 heat toward the target; evaluation stream ticks 6–10 oscillate around 72°F with heater toggling.
- Verification log updated with Phase 4 timestamps in `verifications/20251007T154720_checks.log`.

## Validation
- `npm --prefix workspaces/Describing_Simulation_0 test`
- `./checks.sh`
- `./tools/run_integration.sh`

## Observations
- Simulation player now publishes frames immediately on start, ensuring integration captures meaningful data without manual delays.
- Evaluation SSE stream remains empty until frames are injected via simulation → evaluation bridge; current automation collects both streams, but evaluation data mirrors simulation due to direct frame injection (no additional evaluation-specific systems yet).

## Status
- Behavioral sweep complete. Ready to proceed with Task 3 (documentation consistency review).
