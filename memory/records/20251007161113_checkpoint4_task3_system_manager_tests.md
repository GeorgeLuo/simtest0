# Task Record â€” Phase 2 Checkpoint IV Task 3

## Summary
- Replaced placeholder SystemManager spec with executable Jest tests verifying registration order, lifecycle hooks, indexed insertion, update execution, removal semantics, and context exposure (`src/core/systems/__tests__/SystemManager.test.ts`).
- Tests currently fail due to `Not implemented` stubs in `SystemManager`, setting up Stage 4 implementation.

## Validation
- `npm run test` fails with expected `Not implemented` errors from SystemManager methods.

## Status
- Task 3 complete; proceed to Task 4 to implement SystemManager logic.
