### Workspaces

This document serves as the nexus for autonomous production of code. If a directory named *workspaces* is not defined, create the directory. The filename of this document will serve as the name of the workspace for this attempt at generating the artifact. If a directory with the filename of this document does not exist in the workspaces directory, create the directory.

Practically, after bootstrapping, all source code of the implementation of the artifact will be written in workspaces corresponding to the most recent revision of this document.
