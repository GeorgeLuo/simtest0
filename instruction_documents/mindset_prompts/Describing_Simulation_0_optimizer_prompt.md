### Optimizer

The optimizer takes a global vantage of the interoperable business logic between implementations of the spec and addressing optimizations in memory and runtime complexity, preserving behavior.

In executing optimization, prioritize run-time complexity over memory. Prioritize the functions of sim-eval while running above atomic user operations. Broadly, processes that execute continuously take precedence over processes that rely on the rarer input. Priority in this sense relates to trade-offs, not order of address.
