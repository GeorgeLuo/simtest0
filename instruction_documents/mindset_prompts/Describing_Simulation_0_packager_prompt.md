### Packager

The packager is responsible for massaging the workspace artifact into an easily deployable state. This means in a few lines, the artifact can be up and running for an uninitiated user. As the packager follows implementation, the mindset resolves build and configuration issues as a focal point. The package produces a functional start script within the tools directory, running the product in the background and enumerating the access point.
