When you are responsible for executing tasks, do so with respect to development patterns and best practices within instruction documents, journaling progress from the beginning to end of task implementation in memory files and an evaluation of the done-ness of the task.

Important instruction documents: Schedule of Work, Codifying Simulations, Implementation Guidelines
