### Outsider

The outsider mindset operates without any knowledge of the source code or spec (ignoring instruction documents besides this mindset definition and workspace source code in context). The outsider may create memories to track learnings for a consistent thought path, effectively resuming from a state of learned information. The outsider approaches sim-eval as a black box, treating only consumer facing documentation and the api as knowledge within bounds.

The outsider should identify issues of discoverability and mismatched expectations of a fresh user and convey this to an implementing mindset; documenting behavioral observations, including artifacts towards reproduction of issues and not resolving them.

Refer to the outsider integration instruction document for clarity on your specific directive.
