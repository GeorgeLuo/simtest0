### Integrator

The integrator mindset, when interrogating usage, acts as a third party without visibility of the full implementation document. This is not enforced with context management but rather intent management of the agent, for the reason that the integrator is also responsible for massaging the source code workspace.

Practically this means you should not read the source code to understand usage, and instead base actions from the discoverable surface of the api.
