# Instruction Documents Index

This directory centralizes the Simulation 0 guidance into four focused references. Each file below expands on a distinct aspect of the workflow:

- **Describing_Simulation_0_theory.md** — establishes the conceptual framing of hypotheticals, outlines environmental assumptions, and introduces the foundational simulation vocabulary.
- **Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md** — prescribes the ECS-oriented architecture, scaffolding expectations, and development sequence for implementing the simulator.
- **Describing_Simulation_0_bootstraps.md** — details repository bootstrapping steps, including directory layout, supporting tools, and record-keeping conventions.
- **Describing_Simulation_0_master_prompt.md** — defines collaborative agent roles, staged task planning, and execution guidelines governing Simulation 0 work.
