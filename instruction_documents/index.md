# Instruction Documents

This directory collects reusable sections from `Describing_Simulation_0.md`.

- [Describing_Simulation_0_theory.md](Describing_Simulation_0_theory.md) - Establishes the conceptual framing for simulations, including hypotheses classification, formal definitions, and baseline assumptions.
- [Describing_Simulation_0_bootstraps.md](Describing_Simulation_0_bootstraps.md) - Outlines repository bootstrapping steps, directory expectations, and verification workflows for setting up the project environment.
- [Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md](Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md) - Defines the ECS-focused scaffolding, architectural checkpoints, and supporting services needed to codify simulations from the specification.
- [Describing_Simulation_0_master_prompt.md](Describing_Simulation_0_master_prompt.md) - Details the task generation and execution roles, including staging guidance for coordinating implementation work.
