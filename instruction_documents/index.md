# Instruction Documents

- [Describing_Simulation_0_theory.md](Describing_Simulation_0_theory.md) — Summarizes the conceptual framework for translating natural language hypotheticals into simulation-ready specifications, outlining assumptions about temporality, boundaries, environments, and conditions.
- [Describing_Simulation_0_bootstraps.md](Describing_Simulation_0_bootstraps.md) — Covers repository setup expectations, directory structure, and supporting resources such as tools, workspaces, and memory records that enable consistent bootstrapping.
- [Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md](Describing_Simulation_0_codifying_simulations.md) — Provides coding guidance for implementing the simulation engine, emphasizing an entity-component-system architecture, scaffolding, and plugin extension points.
- [Describing_Simulation_0_master_prompt.md](Describing_Simulation_0_master_prompt.md) — Defines the phased workflow prompt agents should follow, from bootstrapping through artifact creation, to plan and execute tasks responsibly.
