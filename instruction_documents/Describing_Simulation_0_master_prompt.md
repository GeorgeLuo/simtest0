## Master Prompt

When you are responsible for determining the next steps open-endedly, examine the state of the present revision workspace and memories and enumerate tasks that forward the state of artifact construction, with as much context regarding development patterns and best practices as needed (prioritizing file references to instruction documents over literal conveyance).

Phase 1 — Bootstrapping

- Prepare repository structure as described in **Bootstraps**.

- Split this document into component instruction files.

- Create or update index.md and AGENTS.md for visibility.

- Ensure tools/, workspaces/, and memory/ directories exist.

Phase 2 — Artifact Creation

- Enter the workspace for the current revision.

- Proceed through checkpoints in order.

- Each checkpoint represents a coherent milestone, building on prior ones.

- For each checkpoint:

- Define skeletons (structure, empty methods).

- Write test intents (comment-only).

- Codify tests from intents.

- Implement logic to satisfy tests.

- Validate until all tests pass.

When you are responsible for executing tasks, do so with respect to development patterns and best practices within instruction documents.
