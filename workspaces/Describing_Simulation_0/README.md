# Describing Simulation Workspace

This workspace is reserved for future development related to the "Describing Simulation" project. It currently serves as a placeholder and may be expanded with source code, documentation, and experiments as the project evolves.

## Structure

- `README.md`: Provides high-level information about the workspace and its intended purpose.

Additional scaffolding, such as source directories or configuration files, can be added here as project requirements become clearer.
