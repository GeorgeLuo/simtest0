Observed discrepancies during PID control attempt:
- Simulation start acknowledged, but tick counter stays at 0.
- SSE stream emits keep-alive comments only; no simulation frames.
- System injection fails: HTTP 500, message "No handler registered for message type 'simulation.system.inject'".
- Evaluation player remains stopped, so no evaluation frames appear.
