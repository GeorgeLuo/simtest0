PID control replay succeeded:
- Simulation tick counter advanced continuously during the 5s SSE sample.
- `/simulation/stream` delivered simulation frames instead of keep-alive-only comments.
- Injecting `simulation/systems/PIDControlSystem.js` returned HTTP 200 with `status: success`.
- Evaluation bus still reports `running: false`, but evaluation frames are available via the stream bridge.
