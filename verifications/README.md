# Verification Logs

## Directory purpose
This directory stores the raw output of automated verification runs so that every round of `./checks.sh` (or other
validation tooling) leaves an auditable trail. Timestamped logs let contributors review how the project was validated at
any point in time, reproduce runs when regressions appear, and cite specific evidence when documenting progress in the
workspaces.

## Log naming convention
Logs generated by the repository tooling follow a timestamp-based naming scheme: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.log`. The
14-digit UTC timestamp comes directly from `date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"` and sorts chronologically by filename. When you need
to annotate a run with additional commentary, create a companion Markdown file alongside the raw log using the same
basename (for example, `20250916064042.log` and `20250916064042.log.md`).

## How `checks.sh` records output here
The root-level [`checks.sh`](../checks.sh) script ensures this directory exists, generates a timestamp, and directs all
stdout and stderr from the verification session through `tee` so the terminal output is simultaneously written to the log
file (see `VERIFICATION_DIR`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `exec > >(tee ...)` in the script). The script also registers an exit trap
that reports the final status and echoes the path of the log it just produced, making it easy to reference from commit
messages or workspace notes.

## Referencing logs from workspace notes
When capturing progress in a workspace record, link back to the relevant verification log so readers can inspect the
exact test output. Use a relative path from the note to this directory, for example:

```markdown
- [2025-09-16 06:40 UTC verification run](../../verifications/20250916064042.log)
```

This pattern keeps research notes, implementation details, and their verification evidence connected.
